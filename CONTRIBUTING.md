## Commit Messages

Commit messages are an essential part of the development process. They provide a brief description of the changes made in the commit. Here are some best practices for writing commit messages:

- Do not include personal notes or comments in the commit messages.
- Commit messages should be concise and describe the changes made in the commit.
- Use the imperative mood ("Add feature" not "Added feature" or "Adds feature").
- Start the message with a capital letter.
- Do not end the message with a period.

- Every commit should include a commit message. Commit messages are crucial for understanding the changes made in each commit and maintaining a clean and understandable codebase.
- An effective commit message should clearly describe the changes made in the commit and their purpose. It should be concise, written in the imperative mood, start with a capital letter, and not end with a period.
