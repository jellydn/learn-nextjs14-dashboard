# Learn Nextjs 14

## Chapter 1 - Setup new project

- Setup Nextjs 14 with dashboard template.
- A few points I like about this chapter:
  - Explain overall project structure.
  - Use Typescript.

## Chapter 2 - CSS styling

- Explain how to use Tailwind CSS or CSS Modules.
- Good to introduce `clsx` to combine multiple class names.
- I don't like the import with '@/' convention for CSS file as it's not working nice. It doesn't jump to file on click.

P/S: The absolute path for TS/JS file is working fine.

## Chapter 3 - Optimizing Fonts and Images

- Justify why we need to optimize fonts and images.
- Explain how to use Google Font with nextjs.
- Explain how to use Image component with Tailwind CSS for swapping image between different screen sizes.
